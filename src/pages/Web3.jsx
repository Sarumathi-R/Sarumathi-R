         <p>A dynamic website is one that changes or customizes itself frequently 
            and automatically. Server-side dynamic pages are generated "on the fly"
             by computer code that produces the HTML (CSS are responsible for 
             appearance and thus, are static files). There are a wide range of
              software systems, such as CGI, Java Servlets and Java Server Pages 
              (JSP), Active Server Pages and ColdFusion (CFML) that are available
               to generate dynamic Web systems and dynamic sites. Various Web 
               application frameworks and Web template systems are available for 
               general-use programming languages like Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby 
               to make it faster and easier to create complex dynamic websites.</p> </div>
