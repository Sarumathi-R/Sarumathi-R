         <p>While "web site" was the original spelling (sometimes capitalized 
            "Web site", since "Web" is a proper noun when referring to the World 
            Wide Web), this variant has become rarely used, and "website" 
            has become the standard spelling. All major style guides, such as 
            The Chicago Manual of Style[4] and the AP Stylebook,[5] have reflected 
            this change.

In February 2009, Netcraft, an Internet monitoring company that has tracked Web 
growth since 1995, reported that there were 215,675,903 websites with domain 
names and content on them in 2009, compared to just 19,732 websites in 
August 1995.[6] After reaching 1 billion websites in September 2014, 
a milestone confirmed by Netcraft in its October 2014 Web Server Survey and 
that Internet Live Stats was the first to announce—as attested by this tweet
 from the inventor of the World Wide Web himself, Tim Berners-Lee—the number 
 of websites in the world have subsequently declined, reverting to a level 
 below 1 billion. This is due to the monthly fluctuations in the count of 
 inactive websites. The number of websites continued growing to over 1 billion 
 by March 2016 and has continued growing since.[7] Netcraft Web Server Survey 
 in January 2020 reported that there are 1,295,973,827 websites and in
  April 2021 reported that there are 1,212,139,815 sites across 10,939,637 
  web-facing computers, and 264,469,666 unique domains.
