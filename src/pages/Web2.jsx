         <p>A static website is one that has Web pages stored on the server in 
            the format that is sent to a client Web browser. It is primarily 
            coded in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML); Cascading Style Sheets 
            (CSS) are used to control appearance beyond basic HTML. Images are
             commonly used to create the desired appearance and as part of the
              main content. Audio or video might also be considered "static" 
              content if it plays automatically or is generally non-interactive.
               This type of website usually displays the same information to all
                visitors. Similar to handing out a printed brochure to customers 
                or clients, a static website will generally provide consistent, 
                standard information for an extended period of time. Although 
                the website owner may make updates periodically, it is a manual 
                process to edit the text, photos, and other content and may 
                require basic website design skills and software. Simple forms 
                or marketing examples of websites, such as a classic website,
                 a five-page website or a brochure website are often static 
                 websites, because they present pre-defined, static information
                  to the user. This may include information about a company and 
                  its products and services through text, photos, animations, audio/video, and navigation menus.
