         <p>The Internet is a global network that comprises many voluntarily interconnected 
            autonomous networks. It operates without a central governing body. 
            The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols (IPv4 and IPv6) is 
            an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization 
            of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate
             with by contributing technical expertise. To maintain interoperability, 
             the principal name spaces of the Internet are administered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned 
             Names and Numbers (ICANN). ICANN is governed by an international board of 
             directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and
              other non-commercial communities. ICANN coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the Internet, including domain names, IP addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters. Globally unified name spaces are essential for maintaining the global reach of the Internet. This role of ICANN distinguishes it as perhaps the only central coordinating body for the global Internet.[56]</p> </div>
